# Task 06: Squadmates in the product

Branch: `06-squadmates`. One pull request. One builder agent. Start each stage under the merge conditions below. Read `AGENTS.md` first and send the receipt.

Stage A is steps 1 to 3. This branch lands stage A before PR 12 and PR 18 merge. Stage B is steps 4 to 11. It starts only after those pull requests merge. Stage A does not change a product screen, the seed, or `packages/adapters/src/neon/create-workspace.ts`.

## Goal

Every agent and the master shows its squadmate: a fixed character name from a famous place, and a character drawing whose eyes show the agent's state. Decision 33 in `docs/PLAN.md` governs this task, with the SVG accessible-name exception in step 8. The reference is https://10squads.com/review/characters. Its drawing now lives in `packages/squadmates`. `make verify` returns 0.

## Read

- `docs/PLAN.md`: Decisions (all, decision 33 most of all), State models (Agent loop, Agent on/off)
- `packages/squadmates/src/` and `apps/landing/review-src/characters.mjs`, in full
- `docs/BRIEF.md`: Data model (Agent), Definition of done
- Each screen file you change, in full, and its design file

## The names

The name belongs to the agent image, not to the account. No customer can change it. The design's agent name ("Orders") becomes the role tag.

| Image id | Character | Named after | Role tag |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| master | Petra | Petra, Jordan | Master in the package. No visible product role tag; see step 8 for the SVG accessible name. |
| orders | Pisa | Pisa, Italy | Orders |
| support | Kyoto | Kyoto, Japan | Support |
| marketing | Rio | Rio de Janeiro, Brazil | Marketing |
| finance | Zurich | Zurich, Switzerland | Finance |
| inventory | Giza | Giza, Egypt | Inventory |
| market | Machu | Machu Picchu, Peru | Market researcher |
| website | Angkor | Angkor Wat, Cambodia | Website builder |
| analytics | Delphi | Delphi, Greece | Analytics |
| hr | Sydney | Sydney, Australia | People |

Decision 33 fixes the name for the `hr` image. The original reference sheet had no People character. Task 06 added Sydney and required the pull request to report that addition for Moe. The current drawing rules and source follow [decision 33](../docs/PLAN.md#decisions).

## Steps, in order

The geometry, colour and unchanged-review-page checks below apply to the original package migration. Later mascot changes follow [decision 33](../docs/PLAN.md#decisions).

1. Add this task file in the first commit.
2. Make `packages/squadmates`, a pure TypeScript package with no runtime dependency. Move the drawing from `apps/landing/review-src/squadmates.mjs` into it, with the same geometry and colours. Export the table above, the nine Agent loop states, and one function that returns the SVG markup for an image id, a state and a size. An unknown image id is an error. A unit test checks that every agent image in the seed has a squadmate.
3. Make `apps/landing` import the package, and delete its own copy. The review page at `/review/characters` must not change. Compare the built page before and after.
4. The display name is computed, not stored. Do not add a column. Use the [repository name mapping](../docs/foundation.md#database-and-repository-scope). Keep the design names in the seed and the `"Master"` constant in `packages/adapters/src/neon/create-workspace.ts`. A test checks that a new workspace's master reads as Petra.
5. The state of the drawing: the product has no agent runtime yet. Draw an agent that is on in the idle state (it blinks), and an agent that is off in the Dropped state (asleep). Task 05 will pass the real Agent loop state later. Keep that one input.
6. Add one React component, `Squadmate`, in `apps/web/src/workspace/`. It renders the package markup. The markup is our own constant with no user text, so one `biome-ignore` for the inner HTML is allowed, with that reason. The SVG has `role="img"` and an `aria-label` with the name and the role.
7. Show the squadmate in every place that shows the master or an agent: the sidebar (the master header and the agent rows), the dock (header and message tags), Overview (agents at a glance and the approval items), Squads cards, the agent dashboard header, Chat (message tags and hand-offs), Traffic (the hub, the event list and the inspector), Rules (the agent select and the rule rows), and sign-up step 3 (the agents to pick). Do not change the homepage; task 07 owns it.
8. The text rule. A title or a name shows the character name. Where the design has room for a second label, the design's agent name follows it as a tag, as on the sheet. Where a line is tight, such as an event row, show the 16 or 20 px squadmate and the character name only. Every sentence that says the master's name says "Petra".
    - The sidebar, approved by Moe on 3 November 2026. The reference is `docs/designs/squadmates/sidebar.png` ("After task 06"), drawn by `docs/designs/squadmates/sidebar.html`. Match its header and rows. The sizes and spacing of the sidebar stay as in the design. The sidebar agent rows: the 24 px squadmate replaces the tint square. The row text is the character name, then the design's agent name as a grey tag, for example "Pisa" then "Orders". The status dot stays. The sidebar header shows Petra in place of the "M" mark and the word "Master".
    - "Master" is replaced with "Petra" in visible product copy, decided by Moe on 3 November 2026. Where the word names the role, rewrite the sentence around Petra. Moe later kept one exception: icon-only Petra drawings retain the package's `aria-label="Petra, Master"`, the character name plus the role. This includes the sidebar header, dock header, agent dashboard header, and Traffic Petra card. Decorative drawings inside a control that already has a name drop the SVG label. Do not change package markup for this copy rule. The homepage stays with task 07. The known strings:

      | Design text | Build text |
      | --- | --- |
      | Master (sidebar header, dock header, message tags, agent lists) | Petra |
      | Chat with the master (sidebar item and its `aria-label`) | Chat with Petra |
      | Ask Master (dock button, from `masterName`) | Ask Petra |
      | Each part of your business gets its own squad: one agent with its tools. A master squad coordinates them, and every squad works toward your mission. | Each part of your business gets its own squad: one agent with its tools. Petra coordinates them, and every squad works toward your mission. |
      | Ask the master what's going on; it routes the question to the right squad. | Ask Petra what's going on; Petra routes the question to the right squad. |
      | The master uses this to brief every squad. You can change it later. | Petra uses this to brief every squad. You can change it later. |
      | The master will propose a mission for each squad | Petra will propose a mission for each squad |
      | Ask Orders for status through the master | Ask Orders for status through Petra |

      Search the screens in step 7 for "master", case-insensitive, and fix any visible string this table misses. Apply the skill sentence replacement at the agent-detail display boundary; keep the seed and design text. Inventory expectations apply the same prose rule in `e2e/squadmate-copy.ts`; homepage and sign-in inventories stay raw. Preserve the SVG exception above. Code names such as `masterName` stay. Report each changed string in the pull request.
9. Keep the layout. The squadmate takes the size and the place of the mark it replaces: the initial, the tint dot or the icon. No box moves. At 390 px there is no horizontal scroll.
10. Update the screenshot baselines. Attach for each changed screen, at 1440 px and 390 px: the design, the build before, and the build after. Moe compares them.
11. Rebase on `main` last. Append one line to `progress.md` with the commit script.

## Done when

- [ ] `packages/squadmates` has the drawing and the table, and `/review/characters` is the same page as before
- [ ] Every place in step 7 shows the squadmate and the character name
- [ ] A new workspace's master is Petra, and no screen shows "Master" as a name
- [ ] The sidebar rows show the squadmate, the character name and the role tag, and the sidebar item reads "Chat with Petra". Visible copy on the screens in step 7 uses Petra; SVG accessible names follow step 8.
- [ ] The nine done numbers in `AGENTS.md` are unchanged
- [ ] Each icon-only squadmate has an accessible name, and Tab still reaches every control
- [ ] At 390 px there is no horizontal scroll outside the table boxes
- [ ] `make verify` returns 0

## Do not

- Do not let a customer rename the master or an agent.
- Do not store the character name in the database.
- Do not change a colour outside the token list, except the squadmate drawing itself, which decision 33 adds.
- Do not change the homepage.
